# ConvLSTM Configuration: Quick Test (Development/Debugging)
# This configuration is for rapid testing and debugging
# Uses minimal resources and trains quickly

# Data Configuration
data:
  data_path: "data/regional_weather.nc"
  output_dir: "checkpoints/quick_test"
  
  # Data splitting (temporal ordering preserved)
  train_ratio: 0.7
  val_ratio: 0.15
  # Remaining 0.15 for test set
  
  # Window configuration
  window_size: 4  # Reduced from 6 for faster testing
  target_offset: 1  # Predict 12 hours ahead

# Region Configuration
region:
  # Downstream region (target prediction area)
  # Smaller region for faster testing
  downstream:
    lat_min: 30.0
    lat_max: 35.0
    lon_min: 110.0
    lon_max: 115.0
  
  # Upstream region (not used in quick test)
  include_upstream: false

# Model Architecture
model:
  input_channels: 56  # 5 vars × 11 levels + 1 precip
  hidden_channels: [8, 16]  # Very small model for quick testing
  kernel_size: 3
  output_channels: 1  # Precipitation only

# Training Configuration
training:
  # Optimization
  learning_rate: 0.001
  weight_decay: 0.00001
  batch_size: 2
  num_epochs: 5  # Just a few epochs for testing
  
  # Gradient management
  gradient_clip_norm: 1.0
  gradient_accumulation_steps: 1
  
  # Memory optimization
  use_amp: false  # Disable for easier debugging
  num_workers: 0  # Single-threaded for debugging
  pin_memory: false
  
  # Scheduler
  scheduler_type: "none"  # No scheduler for quick test

# Loss Function Configuration
loss:
  high_precip_threshold: 10.0  # mm
  high_precip_weight: 3.0  # Weight multiplier for high precipitation
  latitude_weighting: true  # Apply cos(latitude) weighting

# Checkpointing and Validation
checkpointing:
  checkpoint_frequency: 100  # Save frequently for testing
  validation_frequency: 50  # Validate frequently
  early_stopping_patience: 3  # Short patience for quick test
  save_best_only: true  # Only save best to save space

# Logging
logging:
  log_level: "DEBUG"  # Verbose logging for debugging
  log_to_file: true
  log_to_console: true

# Device Configuration
device:
  device: "auto"  # auto, cuda, cpu
  cuda_device: 0  # GPU index if multiple GPUs available

# Expected Performance
# - Peak memory: <1 GB
# - Training time: ~2-5 minutes per epoch
# - Total training: ~10-25 minutes for 5 epochs
#
# Purpose: This configuration is for:
# - Testing data loading pipeline
# - Debugging model architecture
# - Verifying training loop
# - Quick sanity checks
# - NOT for production use or accuracy evaluation
